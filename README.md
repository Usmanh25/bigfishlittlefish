# Usman_Javascript_Project

## Background

My project is going to be a game called "Big Fish Little Fish" The game has a simple user interface, using only the up and down arrow keys to maneuver a fish up and down along the left side of the screen. The point of the game is to avoid bigger fish and sharks that are rendered into the screen from the right side, transversing from right to left in a horizontal line. If you make contact with a shark, or a fish of your size or bigger, you lose the game. If a fish is smaller and you make contact, the player fish increases in size, and the game speeds up one level. There are only 3 max levels, until the fish is at it's largest possible size. From that point, sharks are rendered twice as fast and the goal is to compile the largest score possible.

Score is calculated as 500 points per second, and 1000 points per eaten fish. As you increase by level, there are 500 points added per eaten fish.


## Functionality & MVPs

In "Big Fish Little Fish," users will be able to:

- Move up and down, controlling the fish's movement

- Add in their name to a submit box after losing, to log their high score (if they do not log in a name and just press the 'submit score' button a generic name is added to the leaderboard

- mute the game music

In addition, this project will include:

- a Main Menu where users can select options to "Play Game", view the "Instructions" or see the "Leaderboard" of high scores, as well as "Mute"

- a "You Lose" Menu, where users can select options to "Play Again" or view "Leaderboard" as well as "Mute"

- some nautical backround music
