# Big Fish Little Fish

## Background

My project is going to be a game called "Big Fish Little Fish" The game has a simple user interface, using the arrow keys to maneuver a fish around the screen. The point of the game is to eat other fish and grow in size. Whie doing so, you must avoid sharks that are rendered into the screen, transversing towards you in horizontal lines. If you are smaller than the shark and make contact, you lose the game. If you are bigger than the shark and make contact, you win.

## Functionality & MVPs

In "Big Fish Little Fish," users will be able to:

- Move up/down/left/right to control the fish's movement

- Increase in size when eating brown or blue fish

- Decrease in size when eating yellow fish

In addition, this project will include:

- a Main Menu where users can select options to "Play Game"

- a "You Lose" Menu, where users can select options to return to the Main Menu
